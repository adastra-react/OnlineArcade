          <h3>What type of information we collect?</h3>
          <p>
            The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable
            information pertaining to a user(s), which may be made available or
            gathered via your use of the Services and interaction with the
            website (“Non-personal Information”). We are not able to identify
            the user from the Non-personal Information that is collected.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to enhance the functionality of the Services and to provide
            you with a better user experience, we collect technical information
            transmitted by your computer (through the use of third-party
            analytical cookies), including certain software and hardware
            information (e.g., the type of browser and operating system your
            device uses, language preference, access time and the domain name of
            the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also collect information about your use of the Services, such as
            user activity (e.g., pages viewed, the amount of time spent on
            particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.). This
            information is collected, amongst other things, for research and
            analytics purposes about your use of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aggregate, anonymize or de-identify the information collected by
            the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on
            its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such
            aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any
            restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to
            others without limitation and for any purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second type of information is individually identifiable
            information, namely information that identifies an individual or may
            with reasonable effort identify an individual (“
            <b>Personal Information</b>”). This may be collected when you
            subscribe for our email newsletters by providing us with your email
            address on the website or when you post a comment including your
            name and email address in response to one of our news pieces. We may
            also collect some of your Personal Information if you use our “Live
            Chat” feature on the website, depending on the level of information
            you provide and the nature of your query. We may also collect
            information such as your name, email address and
            interests/preferences if you register on our membership page and
            submit your preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also collect specific types of connection details and
            information with regard to your device and hardware, such as IP
            addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information,
            the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for
            as long as it remains combined.

          <h4> NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h4>
          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
            exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your
            request in these circumstances.

          <h4> WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h4>
          <p>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
            data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
            measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
            who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
            for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
            response

          <h4> TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h4>
          <p>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within five business
            days. Occasionally it could take us longer than five business days,
            if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
            requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

            We reserve the right to access and verify any Personal Information
            collected from you. In the event that we become aware that a user
            under the age of 18 has shared any information, we will discard such
            information. If you have any reason to believe that a minor has

          <p>
            We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within five business

            Information that we collect. However, we reserve the right to charge
            a reasonable fee if we consider your request excessive, unfounded or
            of a repetitive nature and may refuse to comply with your request in
            such circumstances. We will notify you if your request is complex
            and requires longer than 5 business days to provide a response. We
            will endeavor to keep you updated.
